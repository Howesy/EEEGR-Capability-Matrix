# EEEGR Capability Matrix

A multitier databsase communication system designed by myself during my summer internship at EEEGR in the summer of 2019.
The system was never deployed due to the front end design being unfinished.
While not being the most pretty looking code in places, it certainly has some beautiful pieces of utility hidden within.
